## 1. Transformer

Implementation of the Transformer architecture with two major improvements based on papers: [<b>SwiGLU</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202v1) and [<b>Differential Attention</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258)

## 2. ProxyProp

Implementation of a variant of ProxyProp (Proximal Backpropagation), where weights of the network are updated according to the proximal mapping operator
[<b>Proximal Mapping Operator</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09665)

## 3. ResNetResearch

Primary focus of this task was to research how adversarial images can improve ResNet architecture for image recognition. Also in this task, I investigated how [<b>Activation Sparsity</b>](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QzcZb3fWmW) can help with improving robustness against style and pattern changes in images.

## 4.Reinforcement

Notebook focused on exploring Reinforcement Learning architectures: [<b>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) combined with [<b>Random Network Distillation (RND)</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894) in the context of [<b>MiniHack</b>](https://github.com/facebookresearch/minihack) environments.
